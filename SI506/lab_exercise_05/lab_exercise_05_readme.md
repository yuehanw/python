# SI 506: Lab Exercise 05

This week's lab exercise features three (3) problems that focus on defining functions taking multiple parameters,
nested loops, string manipulation, open/write files, reusing functions previously defined

You will use lab_exercise_05.py to complete the assignment.

You can retrieve the file from Canvas Files or from the Github SI506-2019Fall repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
'lab_exercise_05.py' file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your exercise as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.

The general layout of a SI 506 lab exercise resembles the following:

```python
# START LAB EXERCISE 05
print('LAB EXERCISE 05 \n')

# PROBLEM 01
# Instructions for problem 01 provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 01 SOLUTION

# Write your 01 solution between the BEGIN/END comments.

# Note that for certain problems a required variable may be
# initialized with a default value (e.g., var_int = 0, var_str = '')
# that you will then change. print() statements are occasionally
# provided as a courtesy in order to output variable values
# to the screen.

# END 01 SOLUTION


# PROBLEM 02
# Instructions for problem 02 provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 02 SOLUTION



# END 02 SOLUTION

# PROBLEM 03
# Instructions for problem 03 provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 03 SOLUTION

# Write your 03 solution between the BEGIN/END comments. . . .

# END 03 SOLUTION

# END LAB EXERCISE
```
