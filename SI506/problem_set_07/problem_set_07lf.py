# SI 506 2019F - Problem Set 07

# The following 6 problems cover dictionaries. If a problem
# includes a setup section do not modify, delete or otherwise ignore the setup
# code.

# Functions that you are asked to write will be called directly by the
# auto grader when scoring your submission. Make sure all required statements
# are included in the function body.

# PROBLEM 1
# Working with the empty dictionary <dict_one>, demonstrate your understanding of
# the following concepts and operations:
# 1) adding key-value pairs into the dictionary
# 2) updating the value for a specific key in the dictionary


# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1) Add following key-value pairs into <dict_one>
# KEY       VALUE
# "name"    "William Shakespeare"
# "born"    1564
# "died"    1616
# "age"     2

# 2) Update <age> with <died> - <born>
# 2) Update the value of <age> through calculation using -, (i.e. <died> - <born>) .
# You are required to obtain the values through the dictionary for calculation, instead of using the numbers directly

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# The string <long_lyrics> consists of words separated by " " and "\n"
# Create a dictionary called <char_frequency> so that each key in <char_frequency> is a character (i.e. "a","b"..."z")
# in <lyrics> and its associated value is how many times that character appears in the <long_lyrics>

# For consistency, all the characters should be in lowercase
# (i.e., the frequencies of both "A" and "a" should be aggregated in the dictionary using the key "a")
# " " and "\n" are NOT valid characters.
# Valid characters are limited to the 26 letters that comprise the English alphabet from "a" to "z"
# Be careful of KeyErrors, since <char_frequency> is an empty dictionary.

# PROBLEM 5B
# Working with <char_frequency>, demonstrate your understanding of
# the following concepts and operations:
# 1) designing a function that accepts a single argument and returns a value
# 2) working with strings as sequences
# 3) implementing a for loop
# 4) using dictionary methods such as dictionary.items()
# 5) evaluating values using a conditional statement


# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Write a function named <find_most_common_char> that takes one argument: <long_string>,
# (each string consists of words separated by " " and "\n")
# and returns a string, which contains a single character that has the highest frequency count in <long_string>.

# You are encouraged to reuse the code in PROBLEM 5A
# Note: there is only ONE most common character


# For consistency, all the characters should be in lower case
# (i.e., the frequencies of both "I" and "i" should be aggregated in the dictionary using the key "i")
# " " and "\n" are NOT valid characters.
# Valid characters only include 26 alphabets from "a" to "z"

# Sample case
# If <long_lyrics> was passed into <find_most_common_char> as an argument, <find_most_common_char> should return "e"

# Hints:
# In problem 5A, you are asked to create a dictionary that records the word frequencies.
# With a dictionary that records word frequencies, you can find a word with the highest frequency by
# looping through each dictionary entry and compare the value to the highest frequency being seen so far.
#
# Recommended Step 1: Inside the function, create a dictionary with the correct word frequencies (similar to 5A).
# Recommended Step 2: Next, loop through the dictionary to find the word(key) with the highest frequency.
# Recommended Step 3: return the word as the returned value for the function.

# START PROBLEM 5B SOLUTION

  # do not have to use list, as singleStr is fair enough here

# You can use "long_string_test1", "long_string_test2" to test your function
