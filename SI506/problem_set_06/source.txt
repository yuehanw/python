I dedicate this, my last editorial, to an extraordinary woman who lived by example and compelled us all to see the world through new eyes. By the time you read this, she'll be sailing to Europe, where I know she'll find new walls to break down and new ideas to replace them with. I've heard her called a quitter for leaving, an aimless wanderer. But not all who wander are aimless. Especially not those who seek truth beyond tradition; beyond definition; beyond the image.
- Betty Warren, Mona Lisa Smile
Run mad as often as you choose, but do not faint.

And watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think, we become. My father always said that. And I think I am fine.
- Margaret Thatcher, The Iron Lady
Just keep swimming.

It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.
- Bruce Wayne, Batman Begins
Just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn't mean they're lost forever.
- Professor Charles Xavier, X-Men: First Class
Men don't follow titles, they follow courage.

To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.

Don't give in to hate. That leads to the dark side.

Kid, there are heroes and there are legends. Heroes get remembered, but legends never die. Follow your heart, kid, and you'll never go wrong.
