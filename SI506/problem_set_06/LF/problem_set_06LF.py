"""

The following 6 problems are designed to help you review topics covered in the first half of the semester and prepare you to start working locally on your own devices.

All the testings performed on Gradescope will be done in a similar fashion as what has been done in prior problem sets.

[Note] You are recommended to do this problem set on your laptop and verify that they behave correctly before uploading to Gradescope for grading.

[Note] Unless specified otherwise, all the file operations and hence, their outcomes, are assumed to be in the same order as to how the file content is stored in the file. For instance, if a problem asks you to convert lines in a file all into lower case and store in another file, the order of the lines should be the same in both the original file and the new file.

Problem 0: Prepare folders and files

[Instructions] 

1. Create a folder named problem_set_06.
2. Move this python script (problem_set_06.py) into the folder problem_set_06
3. Download a file named source.txt, from Github/Canvas as part of this problem set, into the folder.
4. After you have completed the above steps, check the output of the provided 
print statements to verify the outcomes.
5. [Note] No code will be written for this problem.

[Explanations & Hints]

We highly highly recommend that you use the terminal commands 
that we cover this week to create all the folders.

* display the current folder
* switch to another folder
* create a folder

Problem 1: Read a file and convert the content into a list

[Instructions] 

1. Assign the variable source_path a string that contains the name of the file, "source.txt".

2. Open the file using source_path, and read each line within the file as a separate string. 
Store these strings in sequence into a list named file_lines_list.

3. Assign the first two lines within file_lines_list as a list with two elements into a variable first_two_lines_list

[Explanations & Hints]

You are likely to use some of the following concepts or functions to solve this problem:
* file operation and function
* list slicing

Problem 2: Define a function that can transform a list into a new list

[Instructions] 

1. Define two functions named transform_a_list_even() and transform_a_list_odd(). 
Each function will take a list of strings as the first and only argument, 
and return a transformed list of strings as the returned value

[A] For transform_a_list_even():
2.1 The function will store the even string (e.g., 2nd, 4th, ...) 
in the original list into the new list, discarding the odd string (e.g., 1st, 3rd, 5th, ...)

2.2 Before storing any string into the new list, transform each string by 
1) removing the following 1 substring: "- ".

2.3 Return the new list as the returned value of this function.

[B] For transform_a_list_odd():
3.1 The function will store the odd string (e.g., 1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) 
in the original list into the new list, discarding the even string (e.g., 2nd, 4th, ...)

3.2 Before storing any string into the new list, 
transform each string by 1) remove the following 6 substrings:
 "-", "...", ",",".", "?", "!", and 2) convert into all lower case.

3.3 Return the new list as the returned value of this function.

[Explanations & Hints]

1. Look at the content of source.txt to see what's inside. It will help you contextualize what these functions can do.

2. You are likely to use some of the following concepts or functions to solve this problem:
* for
* if
* def
* arithmetic operator (e.g.,  the modulus operator %)
* boolean expression
* string operation & function
* list slicing

Problem 4: 
[Instructions] 

1. Assign the variable target_path a string that contains the name of the file, "target.txt".

2. Combine the strings from transformed_file_lines_list_odd and 
transformed_file_lines_list_even into a list of strings and write them 
as a sequence of lines into the file target.txt, using target_path.

2.1 Each string will be in the format of "<nth odd string>|<nth even string>". 
For instance, the 1st string in target.txt will be the result of combining the 
1st odd string and the 1st even string into "<1st odd string>|<1st even string>".

2.2 Before combining two strings, remember to remove the newline character, "\n", 
from the string in transformed_file_lines_list_odd, so that the new string will 
only have one newline character at the end.

3. Check the content of the target.txt to see if your code behaves correctly. 
The target.txt should contain a number of lines that is half of the source.txt.

You are likely to use some of the following concepts or functions to solve this problem:
* file operation and function
* string operation or function
* list
* string formatting

"""
Problem 5: Define a function that will calculate the frequency of a set of selected words in a file
[Instructions] 

1. Define a function output_words_frequency_from_file() that takes three arguments, 
a source file name (source_file_path), a target file name (target_file_path), 
and a list of topic words (topic_words_list). The function will record the aggregated 
frequency of all topic words in the source file into the target file.

2. Use the function transform_a_list_odd() defined in problem 2 to transform the 
content from the source file before calculating the frequency of each word.

2.1 When checking whether a topic word exists in the list, remember to remove any 
whitespace characters (e.g., " " or "\n")  in the list content before making any
comparison. For instance, a string "dream\n" (from the list) will not be the same as
 "dream" (from the topic word list), but "dream" (after removing the newline character 
 from the list content) will be the same as "dream", and should be counted.

3. Append a newline character, \n,  at the end when you write the frequency into the target file
