# but your code should work ANY string s that has ONE word that occurs most frequently
    
# I need to create a dictionary

# I need to split up the string into words

# Once I have a list of words, I need to look at each word

# For each word, I need to find out if I have never seen it before, OR if I have seen it before
    
# And I need to do different things in each of those cases...
# If I've never seen it before, I should make the count be 1
# If I've seen it before I should add 1 to the count (I've now seen it again!)
