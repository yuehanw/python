# SI 506: Problem Set 08

This week's problem set includes six (6) problems that introduce dictionaries, related concepts, and build upon concepts and techniques covered in the course to date.

You will use `problem_set_08.py` to complete the assignment. You can retrieve it from Canvas Files or the Github [SI506-2019Fall](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2019Fall) repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_07.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.

The general layout of a SI 506 problem set resembles the following:

```python
# START PROBLEM SET X
print('PROBLEM SET X \n')

# PROBLEM 1 (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 1 provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION

# Write your problem 1 solution between the BEGIN/END comments.

# Not that for certain problems a required variable may be
# initialized with a default value (e.g., var_int = 0, var_str = '')
# that you will then change. print() statements are occasionally
# provided as a courtesy in order to output variable values
# to the screen.

# END PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION


# START PROBLEM 2 SETUP (do not modify)

# WARNING: For some problems a "setup" section is included in order
# to provide variables, functions or other working code for use
# with the problem(s). Do not change any code located between
# START/END SETUP.

# END SETUP

# PROBLEM 2 (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 2 provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION

# Write your 02 solution between the BEGIN/END comments. . . .

# END PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION

# Additional problems may follow, structured similarly to problems 1 and 2 above.

# END PROBLEM SET
```
